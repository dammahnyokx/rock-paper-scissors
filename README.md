Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are:

Rock – a closed fist

Paper – an open hand

Scissors – a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V

Rules:
Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)

Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)

Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)

If both players choose the same shape, the result is a tie.

How to Play:
Players count to three aloud ("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!") and throw one of the three signs on "Shoot".

The winner is determined by the rules above.

It can be played as a single round or best-of-three (or more) for fun.
